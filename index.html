</span><span style='color:#CA7A17;'>And then wasn't there something about...."<br /> <br /> "Canalopolis?" </span><span style='color:#965503;'>Whitley nodded. </span><span style='color:#78ADDE;'>"That time I called the Martian Ambassador a spy. </span><span style='color:#693462;'>It was at a Tellurian Embassy Ball." </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>"I begin to see what you mean, Captain." </span><span style='color:#58E506;'>"Strike's the name, Cob." </span><span style='color:#965503;'>Whitley's smile was expansive. </span><span style='color:#58E506;'>"Strike, I think you're going to like our old tin pot here." </span><span style='color:#5DD7AF;'>He patted the Aphrodite's nether belly affectionately. </span><span style='color:#91EB88;'>"She's old ... but she's loose. </span><span style='color:#91EB88;'>And we're not likely to meet any Ambassadors or Admirals with her, either." </span><span style='color:#270772;'>Strykalski sighed, still thinking of his sleek Ganymede . </span><span style='color:#91EB88;'>"She'll carry the mail, I suppose. </span><span style='color:#91EB88;'>And that's about all that's expected of her." </span><span style='color:#3491AA;'>Cob shrugged philosophically. </span><span style='color:#78ADDE;'>"Better than tanking that stinking rocket fuel, anyway. </span><span style='color:#78ADDE;'>Deep space?" </span><span style='color:#58E506;'>Strike shook his head. </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>"Venus-Mars." </span><span style='color:#3491AA;'>Cob scratched his chin speculatively. </span><span style='color:#AE8870;'>"Perihelion run. </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>Hot work." </span><span style='color:#6CB4B7;'>Strike was again looking at the spaceship's unprepossessing exterior. </span><span style='color:#CA7A17;'>"A surge-circuit monitor, so help me." </span><span style='color:#3491AA;'>Cob nodded agreement. </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>"The last of her class." </span><span style='color:#91EB88;'>And she was not an inspiring sight. </span><span style='color:#5DD7AF;'>The fantastically misnamed Aphrodite was a surge-circuit monitor of twenty guns built some ten years back in the period immediately preceding the Ionian Subjugation Incident. </span><span style='color:#EF612C;'>She had been designed primarily for atomics, with a surge-circuit set-up for interstellar flight. </span><span style='color:#CA7A17;'>At least that was the planner's view. </span><span style='color:#AE8870;'>In those days, interstellar astrogation was in its formative stage, and at the time of the Aphrodite's launching the surge-circuit was hailed as the very latest in space drives. </span><span style='color:#ECA677;'>Her designer, Harlan Hendricks, had been awarded a Legion of Merit for her, and every silver-braided admiral in the Fleet had dreamed of hoisting his flag on one of her class. </span><span style='color:#CA7A17;'>There had been three. </span><span style='color:#5DD7AF;'>The Artemis , the Andromeda , and the prototype ... old Aphrodisiac. </span><span style='color:#AE8870;'>The three vessels had gone into action off Callisto after the Phobos Raid had set off hostilities between the Ionians and the Solarian Combine. </span><span style='color:#CA7A17;'>All three were miserable failures. </span><span style='color:#CA7A17;'>The eager officers commanding the three monitors had found the circuit too appealing to their hot little hands. </span><span style='color:#CA7A17;'>They used it ... in some way, wrongly. </span><span style='color:#AE8870;'>The Artemis exploded. </span><span style='color:#AE8870;'>The Andromeda vanished in the general direction of Coma Berenices glowing white hot from the heat of a ruptured fission chamber and spewing gamma rays in all directions. </span><span style='color:#5DD7AF;'>And the Aphrodite's starboard tubes blew, causing her to spend her store of vicious energy spinning like a Fourth of July pinwheel under<br />20 gravities until all her interior fittings ... including crew were a tangled, pulpy mess within her pressure hull. </span><span style='color:#5DD7AF;'>The Aphrodite was refitted for space. </span><span style='color:#EF612C;'>And because it was an integral part of her design, the circuit was rebuilt ... and sealed. </span><span style='color:#91EB88;'>She became a workhorse, growing more cantankerous with each passing year. </span><span style='color:#91EB88;'>She carried personnel.... She trucked ores. </span><span style='color:#693462;'>She ferried skeeterboats and tanked rocket fuel. </span><span style='color:#91EB88;'>Now, she would carry the mail. </span><span style='color:#AE8870;'>She would lift from Venusport and jet to Canalopolis, Mars, without delay or variation. </span><span style='color:#693462;'>Regulations, tradition and Admiral Gorman of the Inner Planet Fleet required it. </span><span style='color:#270772;'>And it was now up to David Farragut Strykalski III to see to it that she did.... </span><span style='color:#6CB4B7;'>The Officer of the Deck, a trim blonde girl in spotless greys saluted smartly as Strike and Cob stepped through the valve. </span><span style='color:#6CB4B7;'>Strike felt vaguely uncomfortable. </span><span style='color:#693462;'>He knew, of course, that at least a third of the personnel on board non-combat vessels of the Inner Planet Fleet was female, but he had never actually had women on board a ship of his own, and he felt quite certain that he preferred them elsewhere. </span><span style='color:#3491AA;'>Cob sensed his discomfort. </span><span style='color:#6CB4B7;'>"That was Celia Graham, Strike. </span><span style='color:#2DB770;'>Ensign. </span><span style='color:#2DB770;'>Radar Officer. </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>She's good, too." </span><span style='color:#58E506;'>Strike shook his head. </span><span style='color:#78ADDE;'>"Don't like women in space. </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>They make me uncomfortable." </span><span style='color:#3491AA;'>Cob shrugged. </span><span style='color:#ECA677;'>"Celia's the only officer. </span><span style='color:#78ADDE;'>But about a quarter of our ratings are women." </span><span style='color:#6A9C30;'>He grinned maliciously. </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>"Equal rights, you know." </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>"No doubt," commented the other sourly. </span><span style='color:#5DD7AF;'>"Is that why they named this ... ship 'Aphrodite'?" </span><span style='color:#965503;'>Whitley saw fit to consider the question rhetorical and remained silent. </span><span style='color:#6CB4B7;'>Strike lowered his head to clear the arch of the flying-bridge bulkhead. </span><span style='color:#3491AA;'>Cob followed. </span><span style='color:#CA7A17;'>He trailed his Captain through a jungle of chrome piping to the main control panels. </span><span style='color:#EF612C;'>Strike sank into an acceleration chair in front of the red DANGER seal on the surge-circuit rheostat. </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>"Looks like a drug-store fountain, doesn't it?" </span><span style='color:#3491AA;'>commented Cob. </span><span style='color:#270772;'>Strykalski nodded sadly, thinking of the padded smoothness of the Ganymede's flying-bridge. </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>"But she's home to us, anyway." </span><span style='color:#693462;'>The thick Venusian fog had closed in around the top levels of the ship, hugging the ports and cutting off all view of the field outside. </span><span style='color:#6CB4B7;'>Strike reached for the squawk-box control. </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>"Now hear this. </span><span style='color:#2DB770;'>All officer personnel will assemble in the flying bridge at 600 hours for Captain's briefing. </span><span style='color:#965503;'>Officer of the Deck will recall any enlisted personnel now on liberty...."<br /> <br /> Whitley was on his feet, all the slackness gone from his manner. </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>"Orders, Captain?" </span><span style='color:#2DB770;'>"We can't do anything until the new Engineering Officer gets here. </span><span style='color:#2DB770;'>They're sending someone down from the Antigone , and I expect him by<br />600 hours. </span><span style='color:#2DB770;'>In the meantime you'll take over his part of the work. </span><span style='color:#2DB770;'>See to it that we are fueled and ready to lift ship by 602. </span><span style='color:#2DB770;'>Base will start loading the mail at 599:30. </span><span style='color:#78ADDE;'>That's about all." </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>"Yes, sir." </span><span style='color:#965503;'>Whitley saluted and turned to go. </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>At the bulkhead, he paused. </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>"Captain," he asked, "Who is the new E/O to be?" </span><span style='color:#6CB4B7;'>Strike stretched his long legs out on the steel deck. </span><span style='color:#ECA677;'>"A Lieutenant Hendricks, I. V. Hendricks, is what the orders say." </span><span style='color:#3491AA;'>Cob thought hard for a moment and then shrugged his shoulders. </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>"I. V. </span><span style='color:#ECA677;'>Hendricks." </span><span style='color:#6A9C30;'>He shook his head. </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>"Don't know him." </span><span style='color:#2DB770;'>The other officers of the T.R.S. </span><span style='color:#3491AA;'>Aphrodite were in conference with the Captain when Cob and the girl at his side reached the flying bridge. </span><span style='color:#91EB88;'>She was tall and dark-haired with regular features and pale blue eyes. </span><span style='color:#EF612C;'>She wore a service jumper with two silver stripes on the shoulder-straps, and even the shapeless garment could not hide the obvious trimness of her figure. </span><span style='color:#6CB4B7;'>Strike's back was toward the bulkhead, and he was addressing the others. </span><span style='color:#78ADDE;'>"... and that's about the story. </span><span style='color:#AE8870;'>We are to jet within 28,000,000 miles of Sol. </span><span style='color:#AE8870;'>Orbit is trans-Mercurian hyperbolic. </span><span style='color:#AE8870;'>With Mars in opposition, we have to make a perihelion run and it won't be pleasant. </span><span style='color:#21D3DC;'>But I'm certain this old boiler can take it. </span><span style='color:#91EB88;'>I understand the old boy who designed her wasn't as incompetent as they say. </span><span style='color:#AE8870;'>But Space Regs are specific about mail runs. </span><span style='color:#2DB770;'>This is important to you, Evans. </span><span style='color:#AE8870;'>Your astrogation has to be accurate to within twenty-five miles plus or minus the shortest route. </span><span style='color:#AE8870;'>And there'll be no breaking orbit. </span><span style='color:#CA7A17;'>Now be certain that the refrigeration units are checked, Mister Wilkins, especially in the hydroponic cells. </span><span style='color:#78ADDE;'>Pure air is going to be important." </span><span style='color:#78ADDE;'>"That's about all there is to tell you. </span><span style='color:#2DB770;'>As soon as our rather leisurely E/O gets here, we can jet with Aunt Nelly's postcard." </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>He nodded. </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>"That's the story. </span><span style='color:#693462;'>Lift ship in...." He glanced at his wrist chronograph, "... in an hour and five." </span><span style='color:#965503;'>The officers filed out and Cob Whitley stuck his head into the room. </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>"Captain?" </span><span style='color:#3491AA;'>"Come in, Cob." </span><span style='color:#6CB4B7;'>Strike's dark brows knit at the sight of the uniformed girl in the doorway. </span><span style='color:#3491AA;'>Cob's face was sober, but hidden amusement was kindling behind his eyes. </span><span style='color:#ECA677;'>"Captain, may I present Lieutenant Hendricks? </span><span style='color:#ECA677;'>Lieutenant I-vy Hendricks?" </span><span style='color:#6CB4B7;'>Strike looked blankly at the girl. </span><span style='color:#965503;'>"Our new E/O, Captain," prompted Whitley. </span><span style='color:#ECA677;'>"Uh ... welcome aboard, Miss Hendricks," was all the Captain could find to say. </span><span style='color:#6A9C30;'>The girl's eyes were cold and unfriendly. </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>"Thank you, Captain." </span><span style='color:#6A9C30;'>Her voice was like cracked ice tinkling in a glass. </span><span style='color:#693462;'>"If I may have your permission to inspect the drives, Captain, I may be able to convince you that the designer of this vessel was not ... as you seem to think ... a senile incompetent." </span><span style='color:#6CB4B7;'>Strike was perplexed, and he showed it. </span><span style='color:#ECA677;'>"Why, certainly ... uh ... Miss ... but why should you be so...."<br /> <br /> The girl's voice was even colder than before as she said, "Harlan Hendricks, Captain, is my father." </span><span style='color:#693462;'>A week in space had convinced Strike that he commanded a jinx ship. </span><span style='color:#5DD7AF;'>Jetting sunward from Venus, the cantankerous Aphrodite had burned a steering tube through, and it had been necessary to go into free-fall while Jenkins, the Assistant E/O, and a damage control party effected repairs. </span><span style='color:#5DD7AF;'>When the power was again applied, Old Aphrodisiac was running ten hours behind schedule, and Strike and Evans, the Astrogation Officer, were sweating out the unforeseen changes introduced into the orbital calculations by the time spent in free-fall. </span><span style='color:#6CB4B7;'>The Aphrodite rumbled on toward the orbit of Mercury....<br /> <br /> For all the tension between the occupants of the flying-bridge, Strike and Ivy Hendricks worked well together. </span><span style='color:#AE8870;'>And after a second week in space, a reluctant admiration was replacing the resentment between them. </span><span style='color:#067D10;'>Ivy spent whatever time she could spare tinkering with her father's pet surge-circuit and Strike began to realize that there was little she did not know about spaceship engineering. </span><span style='color:#6CB4B7;'>Then, too, Ivy spent a lot of time at the controls, and Strike was forced to admit that he had never seen a finer job of piloting done by man or woman. </span><span style='color:#555BAF;'>And finally, Ivy hated old Brass-bottom Gorman even more than Strike did. </span><span style='color:#555BAF;'>She felt that Gorman had ruined her father's career, and she was dedicating her life to proving her father right and Brass-bottom wrong. </span><span style='color:#AE8870;'>There's nothing in the cosmos to nurture friendship like a common enemy. </span><span style='color:#5DD7AF;'>At 30,000,000 miles from the sun, the Aphrodite's refrigeration units could no longer keep the interior of the ship at a comfortable temperature. </span><span style='color:#21D3DC;'>The thermometer stood at 102°F, the very metal of the ship's fittings hot to the touch. </span><span style='color:#2DB770;'>Uniforms were discarded, insignia of rank vanished. </span><span style='color:#693462;'>The men dressed in fiberglass shorts and spaceboots, sweat making their naked bodies gleam like copper under the sodium-vapor lights. </span><span style='color:#EF612C;'>The women in the crew added only light blouses to their shorts ... and suffered from extra clothing. </span><span style='color:#6CB4B7;'>Strike was in the observation blister forward, when Ensign Graham called to say that she had picked up a radar contact sunward. </span><span style='color:#CA7A17;'>The IFF showed the pips to be the Lachesis and the Atropos . </span><span style='color:#CA7A17;'>The two dreadnaughts were engaged in coronary research patrol ... a purely routine business. </span><span style='color:#6CB4B7;'>But the thing that made Strike curse under his breath was Celia Graham's notation that the Atropos carried none other than Space Admiral Horatio Gorman, Cominch Inplan. </span><span style='color:#21D3DC;'>Strike thought it a pity that old Brass-bottom couldn't fall into Hell's hottest pit ... and he told Ivy so. </span><span style='color:#91EB88;'>And she agreed. </span><span style='color:#5DD7AF;'>Old Aphrodisiac had reached perihelion when it happened. </span><span style='color:#21D3DC;'>The thermometer stood at 135° and tempers were snapping. </span><span style='color:#3491AA;'>Cob and Celia Graham had tangled about some minor point concerning Lover-Girl's weight and balance. </span><span style='color:#6CB4B7;'>Ivy went about her work on the bridge without speaking, and Strike made no attempt to brighten her sudden depression. </span><span style='color:#965503;'>Lieutenant Evans had punched Bayne, the Tactical Astrophysicist, in the eye for some disparaging remark about Southern California womanhood. </span><span style='color:#CA7A17;'>The ratings were grumbling about the food....<br /> <br /> And then it happened. </span><span style='color:#3491AA;'>Cob was in the radio room when Sparks pulled the flimsy from the scrambler. </span><span style='color:#CA7A17;'>It was a distress signal from the Lachesis . </span><span style='color:#AE8870;'>The Atropos had burst a fission chamber and was falling into the sun. </span><span style='color:#693462;'>Radiation made a transfer of personnel impossible, and the Atropos skeeterboats didn't have the power to pull away from the looming star. </span><span style='color:#693462;'>The Lachesis had a line on the sister dreadnaught and was valiantly trying to pull the heavy vessel to safety, but even the thundering power of the Lachesis' mighty drive wasn't enough to break Sol's deathgrip on the battleship. </span><span style='color:#693462;'>A fleet of souped-up space-tugs was on its way from Luna and Venusport, but they could not possibly arrive on time. </span><span style='color:#693462;'>And it was doubtful that even the tugs had the necessary power to drag the crippled Atropos away from a fiery end. </span><span style='color:#3491AA;'>Cob snatched the flimsy from Sparks' hands and galloped for the flying-bridge. </span><span style='color:#270772;'>He burst in and waved the message excitedly in front of Strykalski's face. </span><span style='color:#7BBCBE;'>"Have a look at this! </span><span style='color:#7BBCBE;'>Ye gods and little catfish! </span><span style='color:#7BBCBE;'>Read it!" </span><span style='color:#7BBCBE;'>"Well, dammit, hold it still so I can!" </span><span style='color:#58E506;'>snapped Strike. </span><span style='color:#ECA677;'>He read the message and passed it to Ivy Hendricks with a shake of his head. </span><span style='color:#91EB88;'>She read it through and looked up exultantly. </span><span style='color:#7BBCBE;'>"This is it ! </span><span style='color:#58E506;'>This is the chance I've been praying for, Strike!" </span><span style='color:#6A9C30;'>He returned her gaze sourly. </span><span style='color:#555BAF;'>"For Gorman to fall into the sun? </span><span style='color:#693462;'>I recall I said something of the sort myself, but there are other men on those ships. </span><span style='color:#CA7A17;'>And, if I know Captain Varni on the Lachesis , he won't let go that line even if he fries himself." </span><span style='color:#067D10;'>Ivy's eyes snapped angrily. </span><span style='color:#78ADDE;'>"That's not what I meant, and you know it! </span><span style='color:#7BBCBE;'>I mean this!" </span><span style='color:#EF612C;'>She touched the red-sealed surge-circuit rheostat. </span><span style='color:#ECA677;'>"That's very nice, Lieutenant," commented Cob drily. </span><span style='color:#78ADDE;'>"And I know that you've been very busy adjusting that gismo. </span><span style='color:#CA7A17;'>But I seem to recall that the last time that circuit was uncorked everyone aboard became part of the woodwork ... very messily, too." </span><span style='color:#067D10;'>"Let me understand you, Ivy," said Strike in a flat voice. </span><span style='color:#555BAF;'>"What you are suggesting is that I risk my ship and the lives of all of us trying to pull old Gorman's fat out of the fire with a drive that's blown skyhigh three times out of three. </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>Very neat." </span><span style='color:#6A9C30;'>There were tears bright in Ivy Hendricks' eyes and she sounded desperate. </span><span style='color:#7BBCBE;'>"But we can save those ships! </span><span style='color:#7BBCBE;'>We can, I know we can! </span><span style='color:#693462;'>My father designed this ship! </span><span style='color:#91EB88;'>I know every rivet of her! </span><span style='color:#CA7A17;'>Those idiots off Callisto didn't know what they were doing. </span><span style='color:#693462;'>These ships needed specially trained men. </span><span style='color:#7BBCBE;'>Father told them that! </span><span style='color:#7BBCBE;'>And I'm trained! </span><span style='color:#7BBCBE;'>I can take her in and save those ships!" </span><span style='color:#6A9C30;'>Her expression turned to one of disgust. </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>"Or are you afraid?" </span><span style='color:#067D10;'>"Frankly, Ivy, I haven't enough sense to be afraid. </span><span style='color:#2DB770;'>But are you so certain that we can pull this off? </span><span style='color:#78ADDE;'>If I make a mistake this time ... it'll be the last. </span><span style='color:#78ADDE;'>For all of us." </span><span style='color:#ECA677;'>"We can do it," said Ivy Hendricks simply. </span><span style='color:#3491AA;'>Strike turned to Cob. </span><span style='color:#3491AA;'>"What do you say, Cob? </span><span style='color:#78ADDE;'>Shall we make it hotter in here?" </span><span style='color:#965503;'>Whitley shrugged. </span><span style='color:#58E506;'>"If you say so, Strike. </span><span style='color:#78ADDE;'>It's good enough for me." </span><span style='color:#91EB88;'>Celia Graham left the bridge shaking her head. </span><span style='color:#78ADDE;'>"We'll all be dead soon. </span><span style='color:#78ADDE;'>And me so young and pretty." </span><span style='color:#6CB4B7;'>Strike turned to the squawk-box. </span><span style='color:#7BBCBE;'>"Evans!" </span><span style='color:#965503;'>"Evans here," came the reply. </span><span style='color:#CA7A17;'>"Have Sparks get a DF fix on the Atropos and hold it. </span><span style='color:#2DB770;'>We'll home on their carrier wave. </span><span style='color:#2DB770;'>They're in trouble and we're going after them. </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>Plot the course." </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>"Yes, Captain." </span><span style='color:#3491AA;'>Strike turned to Cob. </span><span style='color:#7BBCBE;'>"Have the gun-crews stand by to relieve the black-gang in the tube rooms. </span><span style='color:#21D3DC;'>It's going to get hotter than the hinges of hell down there and we'll have to shorten shifts." </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>"Yes, sir!" </span><span style='color:#3491AA;'>Cob saluted and was gone. </span><span style='color:#6CB4B7;'>Strike returned to the squawk-box. </span><span style='color:#7BBCBE;'>"Radar!" </span><span style='color:#ECA677;'>"Graham here," replied Celia from her station. </span><span style='color:#CA7A17;'>"Get a radar fix on the Lachesis and hold it. </span><span style='color:#2DB770;'>Send your dope up to Evans and tell him to send us a range estimate." </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>"Yes, Captain," the girl replied crisply. </span><span style='color:#7BBCBE;'>"Gun deck!" </span><span style='color:#7BBCBE;'>"Gun deck here, sir," came a feminine voice. </span><span style='color:#693462;'>"Have number two starboard torpedo tube loaded with a fish and a spool of cable. </span><span style='color:#78ADDE;'>Be ready to let fly on short notice ... any range." </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>"Yes, sir!" </span><span style='color:#EF612C;'>The girl switched off. </span><span style='color:#ECA677;'>"And now you, Miss Hendricks." </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>"Yes, Captain?" </span><span style='color:#6A9C30;'>Her voice was low. </span><span style='color:#067D10;'>"Take over Control ... and Ivy...."<br /> <br /> "Yes?" </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>"Don't kill us off." </span><span style='color:#6A9C30;'>He smiled down at her. </span><span style='color:#6A9C30;'>She nodded silently and took her place at the control panel. </span><span style='color:#5DD7AF;'>Smoothly she turned old Aphrodisiac's nose sunward....<br /> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> Lashed together with a length of unbreakable beryllium steel cable, the Lachesis and the Atropos fell helplessly toward the sun. </span><span style='color:#CA7A17;'>The frantic flame that lashed out from the Lachesis' tube was fading, her fission chambers fusing under the terrific heat of splitting atoms. </span><span style='color:#91EB88;'>Still she tried. </span><span style='color:#91EB88;'>She could not desert her sister ship, nor could she save her. </span><span style='color:#AE8870;'>Already the two ships had fallen to within 18,000,000 miles of the sun's terrifying atmosphere of glowing gases. </span><span style='color:#693462;'>The prominences that spouted spaceward seemed like great fiery tentacles reaching for the trapped men on board the warships. </span><span style='color:#693462;'>The atmospheric guiding fins, the gun-turrets and other protuberances on both ships were beginning to melt under the fierce radiance. </span><span style='color:#AE8870;'>Only the huge refrigeration plants on the vessels made life within them possible. </span><span style='color:#CA7A17;'>And, even so, men were dying. </span><span style='color:#5DD7AF;'>Swiftly, the fat, ungainly shape of old Aphrodisiac drew near. </span><span style='color:#6CB4B7;'>In her flying-bridge, Strike and Ivy Hendricks watched the stricken ships in the darkened viewport. </span><span style='color:#21D3DC;'>The temperature stood at 140° and the air was bitter with the smell of hot metal. </span><span style='color:#067D10;'>Ivy's blouse clung to her body, soaked through with perspiration. </span><span style='color:#6A9C30;'>Sweat ran from her hair into her eyes and she gasped for breath in the oven hot compartment. </span><span style='color:#6CB4B7;'>Strike watched her with apprehension. </span><span style='color:#067D10;'>Carefully, Ivy circled the two warships. </span><span style='color:#693462;'>From the starboard tube on the gun-deck, a homing rocket leapt toward the Atropos . </span><span style='color:#693462;'>It plunged straight and true, spilling cable as it flew. </span><span style='color:#693462;'>It slammed up against the hull, and stuck there, fast to the battleship's flank. </span><span style='color:#693462;'>Quickly, a robocrane drew it within the ship and the cable was made secure. </span><span style='color:#AE8870;'>Like cosmic replicas of the ancient South American "bolas," the three spacecraft whirled in space ... and all three began that sunward plunge together. </span><span style='color:#AE8870;'>They were diving into the sun. </span><span style='color:#5DD7AF;'>The heat in the Aphrodite's bridge was unbearable. </span><span style='color:#21D3DC;'>The thermometer showed 145° and it seemed to Strike that Hell must be cool by comparison. </span><span style='color:#067D10;'>Ivy fought her reeling senses and the bucking ship as the slack came out of the cable. </span><span style='color:#EF612C;'>Blackness was flickering at the edges of her field of vision. </span><span style='color:#EF612C;'>She could scarcely lift her hand to the red-sealed circuit rheostat. </span><span style='color:#6A9C30;'>Shudderingly, she made the effort ... and failed. </span><span style='color:#6A9C30;'>Conscious, but too spent to move, she collapsed over the blistering hot instrument panel.<br /> <br /> " </span><span style='color:#067D10;'>Ivy! " </span><span style='color:#6CB4B7;'>Strike was beside her, cradling her head in his arm. </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>"I ... </span><span style='color:#58E506;'>I ... can't make it ... Strike. </span><span style='color:#2DB770;'>You'll ... have to run ... the show ... after ... </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>all." </span><span style='color:#EF612C;'>Strike laid her gently in an acceleration chair and turned toward the control panel. </span><span style='color:#CA7A17;'>His head was throbbing painfully as he broke the seal on the surge-circuit. </span><span style='color:#EF612C;'>Slowly he turned the rheostat. </span><span style='color:#CA7A17;'>Relays chattered. </span><span style='color:#6A9C30;'>From deep within old Lover-Girl's vitals came a low whine. </span><span style='color:#EF612C;'>He fed more power into the circuit. </span><span style='color:#CA7A17;'>Cadmium rods slipped into lead sheaths decks below in the tube-rooms. </span><span style='color:#58E506;'>The whining rose in pitch. </span><span style='color:#693462;'>The spinning of the ships in space slowed. </span><span style='color:#2DB770;'>Stopped. </span><span style='color:#CA7A17;'>With painful deliberation, they swung into line. </span><span style='color:#2DB770;'>More power. </span><span style='color:#CA7A17;'>The whine changed to a shriek. </span><span style='color:#2DB770;'>A banshee wail. </span><span style='color:#3491AA;'>Cob's voice came through the squawk-box, soberly. </span><span style='color:#58E506;'>"Strike, Celia's fainted down here. </span><span style='color:#78ADDE;'>We can't take much more of this heat." </span><span style='color:#3491AA;'>"We're trying, Cob!" </span><span style='color:#58E506;'>shouted Strike over the whine of the circuit. </span><span style='color:#CA7A17;'>The gauges showed the accumulators full. " </span><span style='color:#7BBCBE;'>Now! " </span><span style='color:#EF612C;'>He spun the rheostat to the stops, and black space burst over his brain.... </span><span style='color:#CA7A17;'>The last thing he remembered was a voice. </span><span style='color:#CA7A17;'>It sounded like Bayne's. </span><span style='color:#CA7A17;'>And it was shouting. </span><span style='color:#7BBCBE;'>"We're moving 'em! </span><span style='color:#7BBCBE;'>We're pulling away! </span><span style='color:#78ADDE;'>We're...." And that was all. </span><span style='color:#693462;'>The space-tug Scylla found them. </span><span style='color:#693462;'>The three ships ... Atropos , Lachesis , and old Aphrodisiac ... lashed together and drifting in space. </span><span style='color:#5DD7AF;'>Every man and woman aboard out cold from the acceleration, and Aphrodite's tanks bone dry. </span><span style='color:#AE8870;'>But they were a safe 80,000,000 miles from Sol.... </span><span style='color:#965503;'>The orchestra was subdued, the officer's club softly lighted. </span><span style='color:#3491AA;'>Cob leaned his elbow on the bar and bent to inspect the blue ribbon of the Spatial Cross on Strike's chest. </span><span style='color:#6A9C30;'>Then he inspected his own and nodded with tipsy satisfaction. </span><span style='color:#6CB4B7;'>He stared out at the Martian night beyond the broad windows and back again at Strike. </span><span style='color:#6A9C30;'>His frown was puzzled. </span><span style='color:#6CB4B7;'>"All right," said Strike, setting down his glass. </span><span style='color:#3491AA;'>"What's on your mind, Cob? </span><span style='color:#78ADDE;'>Something's eating you." </span><span style='color:#965503;'>Whitley nodded very slowly. </span><span style='color:#555BAF;'>He took a long pull at his highball. </span><span style='color:#555BAF;'>"I understand that you goofballed your chances of getting the Ganymede back when Gorman spoke his piece to you...."<br /> <br /> "All I said to him...."<br /> <br /> "I know. </span><span style='color:#78ADDE;'>I know what you said ... and it won't bear repeating. </span><span style='color:#78ADDE;'>But you're not fooling me. </span><span style='color:#91EB88;'>You've fallen for old Lover-Girl and you don't want to leave her. </span><span style='color:#2DB770;'>Ver-ry commendable. </span><span style='color:#2DB770;'>Loyal! </span><span style='color:#7BBCBE;'>Stout fellah! </span><span style='color:#067D10;'>But what about Ivy?" </span><span style='color:#067D10;'>"Ivy?" </span><span style='color:#3491AA;'>Cob looked away. </span><span style='color:#58E506;'>"I thought that you and she ... well, I thought that when we got back ... well...."<br /> <br /> Strike shook his head. </span><span style='color:#91EB88;'>"She's gone to the Bureau of Ships with a designing job." </span><span style='color:#3491AA;'>Cob waved an expressive arm in the air. </span><span style='color:#7BBCBE;'>"But dammit, man, I thought...."<br /> <br /> "The answer is no . </span><span style='color:#067D10;'>Ivy's a nice girl ... but...." He paused and sighed. </span><span style='color:#2DAD3B;'>"Since she was promoted to her father's old rank ... well...." He shrugged. </span><span style='color:#ECA677;'>"Who wants a wife that ranks you?" </span><span style='color:#3491AA;'>"Never thought of that," mused Cob. </span><span style='color:#CA7A17;'>For a long while he was silent; then he pulled out an address book and leafed through until he came to the pages marked "Canalopolis, Mars." </span><span style='color:#270772;'>And he was gratified to see that Lieutenant Commander David Farragut Strykalski III was doing the same. </span></body>
